# Leetcode-Metrics-Project
I have created a mini project in which if we enter our leetcode username then it will give us the statistics of leetcode profile that how many problems have been solved, how many of easy-level, how many of medium-level and how many of hard-level. For this I have used leetcode's API to fetch the information.
